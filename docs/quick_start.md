**1. Install Anaconda and PyCharm**

*   First, you need to install Anaconda and PyCharm. Follow the installation guides on their respective websites to complete the installation.
**2. Create an Anaconda Environment**
1.  Open Anaconda Prompt.
2.  Use the following command to create a new virtual environment (e.g., `TensorDL-MPC_env`):
```bash
conda create --name TensorDL-MPC_env python=3.9
```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate TensorDL-MPC_env
```
**3. Install Dependencies**
In the activated virtual environment, use the following command to install TensorFlow and NumPy:
```bash
conda install tensorflow numpy
```
If you want to install other dependencies, such as Scikit-learn, use the following command:
```bash
conda install scikit-learn  # pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**4. Create a PyCharm Project**

1.  Open PyCharm.
2.  Click "Create New Project".
3.  Select "Python" as the project type.
4.  Choose "Existing interpreter" and select your Anaconda virtual environment.
**5. Clone the Code Repository**
1.  In PyCharm, use the Git repository browser to clone the TensorDL-MPC code repository into your project directory.
**6. Configure PyCharm**
1.  In PyCharm, go to "File" -> "Settings" (or press Ctrl+Alt+S).
2.  Select "Project: TensorDL-MPC" -> "Python Interpreter".
3.  In the "Python Interpreter" page, click "Add" to add your Anaconda virtual environment.
**7. Run the Example**
1.  In PyCharm, find the example script file (e.g., `example.py`).
2.  Right-click on the file and select "Run 'example.py'".
**8. Notes**
*   **Virtual Environment**: Make sure you select the correct Anaconda virtual environment when creating the PyCharm project.
*   **Dependencies**: Make sure you have configured the correct Python interpreter and dependencies in PyCharm.
